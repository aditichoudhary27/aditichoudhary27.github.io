And since you've clicked on this anyway, you're coming along for the ride. Sorry, I don't make the rules. </p><p>I stepped out and travelled by myself after what felt like an eternity but realistically, two years, and it was one of the best experiences I've had in a while. But before I get to the things I experienced and the things I learnt about myself, there is so much that I learnt about other people. Since my last experience of living in a public setting was 2nd year of college, it's an understatement when I say that my social setting radar was excessively inadequate.  </p><p>I met extremely cool people, unlikely friends, insufferable blabbermouths and creeps; so you know, the whole mix. And while this taught me a lot as to how you're supposed to behave as a 24 year old, it was so much more entertaining than that life lesson. </p><p>Ah, shit, I forgot to set context. I was in Goa for a month (and yes, you should be slightly jealous, this was awesome), so the stuff up there should make more sense now. </p><p>Coming back to the fun bits, I realised that stepping out of comfort zone (essentially anything outside my room) was so crucial to getting back to old self. It felt so good to figure out more than what I feel like having for lunch that day, or what movie to start because I'm too bored. It sounds like a tiny little thing to get excited about but it's so nice to be in it, to do one fun thing and change my day entirely.</p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://aditichoudhary.com/media/posts/8/9E8514CB-33B1-456B-9172-360FBD9AD8FA.JPEG" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://aditichoudhary.com/media/posts/8/responsive/9E8514CB-33B1-456B-9172-360FBD9AD8FA-xs.JPEG 300w, https://aditichoudhary.com/media/posts/8/responsive/9E8514CB-33B1-456B-9172-360FBD9AD8FA-sm.JPEG 480w, https://aditichoudhary.com/media/posts/8/responsive/9E8514CB-33B1-456B-9172-360FBD9AD8FA-md.JPEG 768w, https://aditichoudhary.com/media/posts/8/responsive/9E8514CB-33B1-456B-9172-360FBD9AD8FA-lg.JPEG 1024w" alt="" width="3334" height="2192"></figure><p>It felt nice to explore these ridiculously pretty places, to float around in the ocean and get destroyed by the waves (I've got witnesses), to get drunk off of my mind and make a fool out of myself, get the craziest tan a two weeks before graduation, drink in shady bars; the whole works. </p><p>This was the first bit of ocean water I stepped into and it scared the absolute life out of me. I was convinced I'm gonna somehow mess up standing halfway in the water and that's it. Two seconds later I lost my balance and that fear solidified.</p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://aditichoudhary.com/media/posts/8/IMG_20220319_163502.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://aditichoudhary.com/media/posts/8/responsive/IMG_20220319_163502-xs.jpg 300w, https://aditichoudhary.com/media/posts/8/responsive/IMG_20220319_163502-sm.jpg 480w, https://aditichoudhary.com/media/posts/8/responsive/IMG_20220319_163502-md.jpg 768w, https://aditichoudhary.com/media/posts/8/responsive/IMG_20220319_163502-lg.jpg 1024w" alt="" width="4608" height="3456"></figure><p>But since I did not die, I learnt nothing and immediately went to getting in the water every day. So much so that my workstation looked a little bit like this and the water you see a little further ahead was my hour-long break after 30 minutes of work, 4 times a day. </p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://aditichoudhary.com/media/posts/8/IMG_20220321_110001.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://aditichoudhary.com/media/posts/8/responsive/IMG_20220321_110001-xs.jpg 300w, https://aditichoudhary.com/media/posts/8/responsive/IMG_20220321_110001-sm.jpg 480w, https://aditichoudhary.com/media/posts/8/responsive/IMG_20220321_110001-md.jpg 768w, https://aditichoudhary.com/media/posts/8/responsive/IMG_20220321_110001-lg.jpg 1024w" alt="" width="3456" height="4608"></figure><p>After the water frenzy and the promised crazy tan, came the 'exploring Goa' bit and my goodness is this place just phenomenal. I saw some of the most beautiful architecture, grandeur and history all in one place. Somehow everything from regular roads in a residential colony to old museums, it was all so mesmerising, I almost looked shady to the people passing by because I was staring too much.</p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://aditichoudhary.com/media/posts/8/DB17EE5F-72BD-4EAB-87C8-FE179194DFA3.JPEG" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://aditichoudhary.com/media/posts/8/responsive/DB17EE5F-72BD-4EAB-87C8-FE179194DFA3-xs.JPEG 300w, https://aditichoudhary.com/media/posts/8/responsive/DB17EE5F-72BD-4EAB-87C8-FE179194DFA3-sm.JPEG 480w, https://aditichoudhary.com/media/posts/8/responsive/DB17EE5F-72BD-4EAB-87C8-FE179194DFA3-md.JPEG 768w, https://aditichoudhary.com/media/posts/8/responsive/DB17EE5F-72BD-4EAB-87C8-FE179194DFA3-lg.JPEG 1024w" alt="" width="3389" height="2238"></figure><p>The more I roamed around, the more I realised how deeply I missed doing that. The whole time I was sitting in my room thinking "this is exactly what I like and nothing else" was garbage and I was lying to myself. </p><p>Doing all of this made me go back to my old self, but not entirely. Because I'll be honest, she didn't know a lot either. So I've made some modifications and updates, it feels great so far. I learnt and unlearnt a lot of things about myself and I'm extremely happy with the person that this trip made me. So maybe I'll make more trips, let's see what person comes out the other end; and if she's even cooler, don't blame me, I warned you with this entire blog. </p><p>Oh! And I finally graduated (woohoo). </p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://aditichoudhary.com/media/posts/8/IMG_20220411_222111.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://aditichoudhary.com/media/posts/8/responsive/IMG_20220411_222111-xs.jpg 300w, https://aditichoudhary.com/media/posts/8/responsive/IMG_20220411_222111-sm.jpg 480w, https://aditichoudhary.com/media/posts/8/responsive/IMG_20220411_222111-md.jpg 768w, https://aditichoudhary.com/media/posts/8/responsive/IMG_20220411_222111-lg.jpg 1024w" alt="" width="4608" height="3456"></figure><p>Fin. </p></div><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on May 9, 2022</div><div class="post__footer__col"><div class="post__share"></div></div><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav__prev">Previous Post<h5><a href="https://aditichoudhary.com/damn.html" class="inverse" rel="prev">Damn.</a></h5></div></nav><div class="post__bio"><div><h3><a href="https://aditichoudhary.com/authors/aditi-choudhary/" class="inverse" title="Aditi Choudhary">Aditi Choudhary</a></h3></div></div></footer></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by <a href="https://getpublii.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Publii</a></div></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://aditichoudhary.com/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=c3bbc0611ea6a5405014eaca34fe1814"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.navbar'};</script><script>/*<![CDATA[*/var images=document.querySelectorAll("img[loading]");for(var i=0;i<images.length;i++){if(images[i].complete){images[i].classList.add("is-loaded")}else{images[i].addEventListener("load",function(){this.classList.add("is-loaded")},false)}};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>

And there was so much confidence -nay, arrogance in the last post. But oh well!</p><p>It's the 31st so this conversation I'm about to have with this page seems fit. 2021 was good, I did so much more than I had in 2020 and so much more than I planned. Ironically, as I write this I'm thinking about how I'm going to complete that illustration I wanted to make for the cover of this blog. But 12am is far away, so you'll be getting not a blog but just live updates of how that's working out for me. </p><p>I graduated college this year, travelled a bit, got a job, found out I actually do like Sushi; it's been a lot, guys. I just realised a few days back that I've been working for about 6 months now, and it felt crazy to think about that. </p><p>Update- the illustration is coming along quite well so far. </p><p>I definitely did not complete everything I claimed in my previous post, but I don't really feel bad about that. I did a lot, just not from that list.<br>Which is why I've decided to under-plan my new year. Of course I'm going to do cool things, it's just what I do; but I'm really excited for everything I don't know yet. I realised in the last two years that I've been majorly away from social spaces, I turned excessively <em><strong>me</strong></em>. And that's something I definitely don't want, because if left to my own devices, I get sad about not following through with plans while also actively avoiding doing anything. And that's no way to start off the year.</p><p>Update- I finished the illustration and it looks brilliant. </p><p>I called this "Things &amp; Stuff" because it's arguably the best line to say when someone asks what's happening. It's vague, promising, slightly annoying and true all at the same time. So 'Things &amp; Stuff' is exactly what's happening this entire year, spoiler alert. </p><p>Oh and I definitely need to drink more water, but that's as far as I'm willing to go with plans. </p><p>Fin. </p></div><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on December 31, 2021</div><div class="post__footer__col"><div class="post__share"></div></div><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav__prev">Previous Post<h5><a href="https://aditichoudhary.com/irregular.html" class="inverse" rel="prev">Irregular</a></h5></div></nav><div class="post__bio"><div><h3><a href="https://aditichoudhary.com/authors/aditi-choudhary/" class="inverse" title="Aditi Choudhary">Aditi Choudhary</a></h3></div></div></footer></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by <a href="https://getpublii.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Publii</a></div></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://aditichoudhary.com/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=c3bbc0611ea6a5405014eaca34fe1814"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.navbar'};</script><script>/*<![CDATA[*/var images=document.querySelectorAll("img[loading]");for(var i=0;i<images.length;i++){if(images[i].complete){images[i].classList.add("is-loaded")}else{images[i].addEventListener("load",function(){this.classList.add("is-loaded")},false)}};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
